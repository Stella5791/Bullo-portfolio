  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">The Intersection of Linguistics and NLP: Where do I come in?</h1>

  <p class="mb-6">Natural Language Processing, often called NLP, aims to help machines understand and generate human language. But language is not simple. It is full of complexities, shaped by context, and rich with cultural nuances. To truly understand language, NLP needs to go beyond just processing the surface of text.</p>

  <p class="mb-6">Linguistics offers many tools that help NLP systems become more accurate and sensitive to culture. While many linguistic fields contribute, my main focus is on metaphor theory, pragmatics, and discourse and sentiment analysis. This article explores these areas and how they enhance NLP.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-6">Metaphor Theory: Unlocking Hidden Meaning</h2>

  <p class="mb-6">Metaphors are part of everyday language, often used without us even realizing. They let us express ideas by comparing one thing to another. For instance, life is commonly described as a journey. It is hard to talk about life without mentioning paths, crossroads, or twists and turns. These expressions clearly show the life-as-journey metaphor.</p>

  <p class="mb-6">Metaphors also carry emotional and cultural meanings. If NLP systems overlook them, they may miss the real intent behind words. In healthcare communication, phrases like “fighting a disease” or “being a survivor” are charged with emotion. When NLP tools recognize these metaphors, they help chatbots and health apps respond with understanding and empathy, making interactions more meaningful.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-6">Pragmatics: Reading Between the Lines</h2>

  <p class="mb-6">Pragmatics studies how context shapes what people really mean beyond the literal words. This is vital for NLP systems to handle things like polite requests or unclear statements.</p>

  <p class="mb-6">For example, “Can you open the window?” sounds like a question about ability but usually is a polite request. Teaching machines to grasp this difference helps make conversations smoother and more natural.</p>

  <p class="mb-6">While it remains challenging to add pragmatics fully into NLP, research continues to make systems better at understanding context.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-6">Discourse Analysis: Seeing the Bigger Picture</h2>

  <p class="mb-6">Discourse analysis looks at how sentences connect to form clear communication. In NLP, it helps machines understand how ideas relate, such as cause and effect or contrast.</p>

  <p class="mb-6">Recognizing words like “since” as markers of cause helps NLP interpret arguments and stories accurately. This matters for tasks like summarizing text or analyzing sentiment because knowing how ideas link changes the meaning.</p>

  <p class="mb-6">Discourse analysis also deepens sentiment analysis by considering how contrasting sentiments are presented in context. For example, “Although the service was slow, the staff was friendly” contains mixed feelings that discourse analysis helps resolve.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-6">Where Linguistics Meets Technology: Merging Research and Innovation</h2>

  <p class="mb-6">This part of my work brings together my linguistics background—especially my research on pain metaphors—with my programming skills in NLP and software development.</p>

  <p class="mb-6">I develop specialized tools such as the metaphor tagger. This module detects figurative language in complex health texts. It helps bridge the gap between how patients experience pain and how clinicians understand it by finding metaphors that often carry emotions and meanings beyond literal words. You can explore the metaphor tagger on my <a href="https://github.com/Stella5791/metaphor-tagger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

  <p class="mb-6">A key project using this technology is my app <em>Explain My Pain</em>. It analyzes patient descriptions of pain, identifying metaphors like “fighting a disease” to help health platforms respond with empathy and provide better support. The app and its source code are available on <a href="https://github.com/Stella5791/explain-my-pain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p>

  <p class="mb-6">Here is a simple example of a metaphor detection module in Python that searches for metaphor-related words in text:</p>

  <pre><code>import re

# Sample text from a patient
text = "I feel like I am fighting a constant battle with my illness."

# Simple list of metaphor trigger words
metaphor_triggers = ["fight", "battle", "warrior", "survivor"]

# Find metaphors in text
found_metaphors = [word for word in metaphor_triggers if re.search(r'\b' + word + r'\b', text.lower())]

print("Metaphors detected:", found_metaphors)
</code></pre>

  <p class="mb-6">This code looks for specific metaphor words. In my projects, this is just one step in a complex process that uses advanced NLP models and linguistic rules to understand subtle, context-dependent language.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-6">Why This Matters</h2>

  <p class="mb-6">Linguistic theory lays the groundwork for NLP to understand language as humans do. It considers not only the structure but also the deeper meanings and contexts of what is said. Combining these insights helps create technology that is precise, culturally aware, and useful in many languages and fields.</p>

  <p class="mb-6">This combined approach is key to building language technologies that truly serve the needs of people around the world.</p>
