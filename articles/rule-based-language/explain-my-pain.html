    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
      Pain in endometriosis is frequently described through metaphor, evaluation, and embodied imagery. 
      These descriptions are semantically rich yet difficult to translate into structured clinical documentation. 
      This article presents (1) a linguistically grounded taxonomy of endometriosis pain descriptors derived from corpus-based research, 
      and (2) the design of a rule-based language system that operationalises this taxonomy to generate structured patient and clinician summaries. 
      The paper argues that transparent linguistic modelling offers an interpretable alternative to opaque AI-driven approaches in sensitive health contexts.

    <h3>1. The Translation Gap in Pain Communication</h3>

    <p>
      Endometriosis pain is persistent, cyclical, context-dependent, and multidimensional. 
      Patients frequently rely on metaphor to make invisible sensations communicable:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>“Like broken glass”</li>
      <li>“A tightening band”</li>
      <li>“Electric shocks”</li>
      <li>“Like something burning inside”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Clinicians, however, require structured documentation, categorical clarity, and reproducible summaries. 
      Numeric pain scales capture intensity but not mechanism. Free text preserves experience but resists standardisation. 
      This creates a structural translation gap between lived experience and medical record.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>2. Research Foundations</h3>

    <p>
      The taxonomy presented here derives from corpus-based analysis of endometriosis pain discourse 
      (≈ 241,000 words). Quantitative analysis showed that <em>pain</em> occurred 2,131 times 
      (≈ 8.8 per 1,000 words), over 120 times more frequently than in the British National Corpus.
    </p>

    <p>
      31% of instances were figurative. These metaphors were not random; 
      they formed recurring semantic patterns structured around mechanisms such as cutting, burning, pressure, invasion, and entrapment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The taxonomy follows Conceptual Metaphor Theory and discourse-based evaluation analysis.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Taxonomy of Pain Descriptors</h3>

    <p>
      The taxonomy is curated, finite, and auditable. Each descriptor is mapped to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Semantic domain</li>
      <li>Metaphor category (if applicable)</li>
      <li>Normalised clinical heading</li>
      <li>Interpretive entailment</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3.1 Sensory–Physical Domains</h4>

    <table class="taxonomy-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Category</th>
          <th>Example Expressions</th>
          <th>Type</th>
          <th>Semantic Entailment</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>

          <td>Cutting Tools</td>
          <td>knife, blade, broken glass</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>heavy, dragging</td>

          <th>Semantic Entailment</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Entrapment</td>
          <td>trapped, locked in</td>
          <td>Emotional</td>
          <td>Lack of escape or control</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Predator / Attack</td>
          <td>biting, attacking</td>
          <td>Emotional</td>
          <td>Pain as external threat</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Transformation</td>
          <td>alien inside me, twisted</td>
          <td>Emotional</td>
          <td>Bodily intrusion or loss of integrity</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h4>3.3 Contextual Occurrence</h4>

    <table class="taxonomy-table">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Context</th>

        <tr><td>Ovulation-related</td><td>Mid-cycle pain</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Intercourse-related</td><td>Dyspareunia</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Bowel-related</td><td>Pain during defecation</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Persistent / Background</td><td>Chronic baseline pain</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>4. From Taxonomy to System Design</h3>

    <p>
      The taxonomy is operationalised in the <strong>Explain My Pain</strong> system, 
      a rule-based, deterministic application built with a Flask backend and YAML taxonomy.
    </p>

    <p>
      User selections are mapped to structured outputs across three dimensions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sensation</strong> (mechanism and quality)</li>
      <li><strong>Emotion</strong> (evaluative stance)</li>
      <li><strong>Context</strong> (trigger or cyclical pattern)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      No predictive modelling is used. The system prioritises interpretability, traceability, and ethical transparency.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>5. Why Rule-Based Modelling?</h3>

    <p>
      In sensitive health contexts, black-box AI systems risk hallucination, overgeneralisation, 
      and loss of patient nuance. A structured taxonomy offers:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Explicit descriptor → category mapping</li>
      <li>Controlled vocabulary</li>
      <li>Auditable semantic logic</li>
      <li>Reproducible outputs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This does not reject AI. It proposes semantic infrastructure beneath it.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>6. Conclusion</h3>

    <p>
      The Language of Endometriosis taxonomy demonstrates how applied linguistics 
      can function as infrastructure for digital health systems. 
      Rather than replacing human interpretation, structured modelling supports it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interpretability can be designed deliberately. 
      Language can be structured without being flattened.
