          <p>
            Pain in endometriosis is frequently described through metaphor, evaluation, and embodied imagery. These descriptions are semantically rich yet difficult to translate into structured clinical documentation. This article presents (1) a linguistically grounded taxonomy of endometriosis pain descriptors derived from corpus-based research, and (2) the design of a rule-based language system that operationalises this taxonomy to generate structured patient and clinician summaries. The paper argues that transparent linguistic modelling offers an interpretable alternative to opaque AI-driven approaches in sensitive health contexts.

          <div class="callout">
            <p class="label">Key idea</p>
            <p>
              A controlled taxonomy + explicit rules can translate lived pain language into structured outputs without losing interpretability.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>1. The Translation Gap in Pain Communication</h2>

          <p>
            Endometriosis pain is persistent, cyclical, context-dependent, and multidimensional. Patients frequently rely on metaphor to make invisible sensations communicable:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>“Like broken glass”</li>
            <li>“A tightening band”</li>
            <li>“Electric shocks”</li>
            <li>“Like something burning inside”</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Clinicians, however, require structured documentation, categorical clarity, and reproducible summaries. Numeric pain scales capture intensity but not mechanism. Free text preserves experience but resists standardisation. This creates a structural translation gap between lived experience and medical record.
          </p>

          <div class="hr"></div>

          <h2>2. Research Foundations</h2>

          <p>
            The taxonomy presented here derives from corpus-based analysis of endometriosis pain discourse (≈ 241,000 words). Quantitative analysis showed that <em>pain</em> occurred 2,131 times (≈ 8.8 per 1,000 words), over 120 times more frequently than in the British National Corpus.
          </p>

          <p>
            31% of instances were figurative. These metaphors were not random; they formed recurring semantic patterns structured around mechanisms such as cutting, burning, pressure, invasion, and entrapment.
          </p>

          <p>
            The taxonomy follows Conceptual Metaphor Theory and discourse-based evaluation analysis.
          </p>

          <div class="hr"></div>

          <h2>3. Taxonomy of Pain Descriptors</h2>

          <p>
            The taxonomy is curated, finite, and auditable. Each descriptor is mapped to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Semantic domain</li>
            <li>Metaphor category (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Normalised clinical heading</li>
            <li>Interpretive entailment</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3.1 Sensory–Physical Domains</h3>

          <pre><code>Cutting tools → penetration / sharp intrusion
Pressure / constriction → compression / restriction
Heat → inflammation / internal heat
Electric force → sudden discharge
Weight → gravitational burden</code></pre>

          <h3>3.2 Emotional and Evaluative Domains</h3>

          <pre><code>Entrapment → lack of escape or control
Predator / attack → external threat
Transformation → intrusion / loss of integrity</code></pre>

          <h3>3.3 Contextual Occurrence</h3>

          <pre><code>Menstruation-related
Ovulation-related
Intercourse-related
Bowel-related
Persistent / background</code></pre>

          <div class="hr"></div>

          <h2>4. From Taxonomy to System Design</h2>

          <p>
            The taxonomy is operationalised in <strong>Explain My Pain</strong>, a rule-based, deterministic application built with a Flask backend and YAML taxonomy.
          </p>

          <p>
            User selections are mapped to structured outputs across three dimensions:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sensation</strong> (mechanism and quality)</li>
            <li><strong>Emotion</strong> (evaluative stance)</li>
            <li><strong>Context</strong> (trigger or cyclical pattern)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            No predictive modelling is used. The system prioritises interpretability, traceability, and ethical transparency.
          </p>

          <div class="hr"></div>

          <h2>5. Why Rule-Based Modelling?</h2>

          <p>
            In sensitive health contexts, black-box AI systems risk hallucination, overgeneralisation, and loss of patient nuance. A structured taxonomy offers:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Explicit descriptor → category mapping</li>
            <li>Controlled vocabulary</li>
            <li>Auditable semantic logic</li>
            <li>Reproducible outputs</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This does not reject AI. It proposes semantic infrastructure beneath it.
          </p>

          <div class="hr"></div>

          <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>

          <p>
            The Language of Endometriosis taxonomy demonstrates how applied linguistics can function as infrastructure for digital health systems. Rather than replacing human interpretation, structured modelling supports it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interpretability can be designed deliberately. Language can be structured without being flattened.
          </p>
