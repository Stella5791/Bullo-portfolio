  <h1>Like a Fire in My Womb</h1>
  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #4b5563;">What pain metaphors can reveal about invisible illnesses like endometriosis</p>
  <p style="font-style: italic; color: #4b5563;">Dr. Stella Bullo</p>

  <p>Metaphors like blades, monsters, or internal fires could be indicative of a chronic condition such as endometriosis.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “It’s like something is stabbing me from the inside.”<br/>
    “It feels like an animal is clawing at my belly from within.”<br/>
    “It’s fire. It’s pressure. It’s something that won’t let me live.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>These are just some of the phrases I’ve heard over the years from other women living with endometriosis.</p>
  <p>And in my case, the one I repeated most often was: “It feels like someone is strangling my uterus.” I would scream it out, curled up on the floor in the fetal position, while my cat purred and kneaded at my head, and my husband panicked looking for the morphine. His hand trembled as he gave it to me, and then he’d look at me helplessly as, minutes later, my body relaxed and my gaze drifted into the fog of the opioid.</p>
  <p>By the time I was finally diagnosed with endometriosis, the disease was already advanced. My quality of life was in ruins. I had spent more than a decade being told it was “normal.”</p>
  <p>Pain descriptions like the ones above are metaphors loaded with intense imagery, extreme bodily sensations, and overwhelming emotions. They are often desperate attempts to put into words what hurts in silence.</p>
  <p>Yet, in the medical consultation room, those words often get reduced to a simple “it hurts a lot.” And that message becomes diluted when translated into a numeric scale from 1 to 10, a useful tool, but often inadequate to capture the complexity of pain.</p>
  <p>That’s when many of us hear phrases like: “you have a low pain threshold,” “as a woman you’re built to withstand pain in the reproductive area,” or “it’ll go away once you have a child” (a child that, in my case, never came precisely because the aggressive endometriosis had already caused infertility).</p>
  <p>And so, between morphine, metaphors, and myths about womanhood, the pain becomes invisible, or worse, normalized.</p>

  <h2>Why does language matter so much?</h2>
  <p>I don’t say this only from lived experience, but also from years of research. I hold a PhD in Linguistics from Lancaster University in the UK and am the founder of <em>The Language of Endometriosis</em>, a project I led at Manchester Metropolitan University to explore how we talk about menstrual pain and how that language can shape, or hinder, diagnosis.</p>
  <p>For years, I listened to, transcribed, and analyzed accounts from people living with endometriosis. Testimonies rich with imagery, metaphors, silences, gestures, and repetition. Words that appeared over and over again in the struggle to say the unsayable.</p>
  <p>These findings were published in academic journals in the fields of linguistics, health communication, and psychology. The project also reached wider audiences through international media like The New York Times, BBC Radio, and Glamour magazine.</p>
  <p>What we found is as evident as it is concerning: often, clinicians and patients are not speaking the same language. That is, they may share a language (English, Spanish, etc.), but not necessarily the same meanings.</p>
  <p>My research suggests there is a gap between what is felt, what is expressed, and what is understood in clinical settings. That gap, far from being trivial, may be one of the reasons why the diagnosis of endometriosis remains slow, uncertain, or delayed.</p>

  <h2>What words can reveal</h2>
  <p>People living with chronic pain, and especially those of us with endometriosis, don’t always describe our pain using clinical language.</p>
  <p>Sometimes we speak of knives, of fire, of pressure, of internal monsters. It’s not exaggeration or melodrama. It’s a way of translating the unnamable.</p>
  <p>In the stories I analyzed, metaphors came up again and again. Far from confusing the issue, they can help communicate more accurately what is a deeply physical, emotional, and often traumatic experience, if we take the time to listen.</p>
  <p>They are attempts, sometimes desperate, to make the invisible visible. To turn pain into something shareable.</p>
  <p>Of course, metaphors aren’t always understood. In some clinical settings, they may seem vague or emotional, or even be dismissed as overly subjective. But that’s no reason to ignore them. On the contrary, it’s a reason to pay more attention, not less.</p>
  <p>So, when someone manages to say something like “it feels like something is crushing me from the inside,” that phrase, though it appears nowhere in diagnostic manuals, could be a vital clue. It could raise a red flag, open up listening, and change the course of a medical history.</p>
  <p>This isn’t about turning patients into doctors or doctors into poets. It’s about meeting somewhere in the middle, where pain is neither silenced nor distorted.</p>

  <h2>Teaching how to name pain</h2>
  <p>Naming pain doesn’t cure it. But it may be the first step toward it no longer being invisible.</p>
  <p>That’s why I believe teaching girls, teens, and anyone who menstruates to talk about their pain in their own words is not a trivial matter or a literary indulgence. It could, in fact, be a public health tool.</p>
  <p>We need to validate metaphors, not dismiss them, but instead unravel or decode them. Listen without rushing. Pay attention when something sounds unusual. All of this, too, is part of care.</p>
  <p>Pain lives in the body, but it needs language to be heard. And when pain has words, even if they’re imprecise, even if they sound strange, it can begin to make sense. It can begin to be met with a response.</p>
  <p>It took me over fifteen years to get a diagnosis. If I had known I could say, “it feels like someone is strangling my uterus,” without being seen as exaggerated or overly emotional, maybe things would’ve been different.</p>
  <p>Let’s help ensure other women don’t have to wait that long. As professionals, as mothers, as friends, as a society. Because every story that gets heard in time has the power to change a life.</p>
