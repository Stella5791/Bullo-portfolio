      <p>I developed this style guide to bridge a gap I saw when I moved from academic research into localisation: how emotional force and pain intensity get diluted in translation.</p>
      <p>During my years studying metaphor and health communication, I analysed how patients describe pain using figurative language, and how clinicians often underestimate those descriptions when they are translated or paraphrased.</p>
      <p>A Spanish patient might say “me duele”, which in context signals substantial suffering, but English systems routinely render it as “it hurts” — a phrase often interpreted as minor discomfort.</p>
      <p>This is not simply a lexical issue. It is semantic attenuation. I created this style guide to help localisation teams prevent such distortions, ensuring that healthcare translations retain their emotional and diagnostic force while respecting cultural tone norms.</p>

      <p>Healthcare translation is never neutral. Every tone choice affects how suffering is perceived. This guide aims to help localisers carry not just the words, but the urgency, empathy, and cultural logic behind them.</p>
