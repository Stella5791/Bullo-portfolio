      Misunderstandings are a common—yet often overlooked—part of human communication. In intercultural contexts, where people use different languages and draw on distinct cultural norms, the potential for misunderstanding grows.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is a Misunderstanding?</h2>
    <p>Misunderstandings are not simply moments of confusion; they are, as Mauranen (2006) puts it, “potential breakdown points in conversation, or at least a kind of communicative turbulence.”</p>
    <p>They occur when the listener makes sense of an utterance—but not in the way the speaker intended. In contrast, <strong>non-understanding</strong> happens when the listener fails to make sense of an utterance at all (Bremer, 1996).</p>
    <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-brand-200 pl-4 italic text-brand-700">
      Whose “fault” is it? The speaker’s? The listener’s? Or is it a shared responsibility, shaped by their expectations and awareness of each other?
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Two Main Sources of Misunderstandings</h2>
    <h3>1. Inadequate Linguistic Proficiency</h3>
    <p>Even when people share a language, their proficiency levels can vary widely. Bremer (1996) identifies common sources of trouble at the <em>linguistic level</em>, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lexical issues (vocabulary gaps)</li>
      <li>Phonological issues (pronunciation, accent)</li>
      <li>Syntactic issues (grammar)</li>
      <li>Semantic issues (word meanings)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bg-yellow-50 p-3 rounded-md border-l-4 border-yellow-300 text-sm">
      <strong>Personal anecdote:</strong> When I first arrived in Manchester, I struggled with the local accent. A sales assistant repeatedly asked, “You being served?” and I could not understand them despite their repetition. I left the shop without buying anything—not because I didn’t want to, but because I felt completely lost.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Pragmatic Mismatch</h3>
    <p><strong>Pragmatics</strong> is the branch of linguistics concerned with meaning in interaction. A <em>pragmatic mismatch</em> occurs when the hearer fails to grasp the intended speech act (e.g. a request, command, or offer), or when the speaker unintentionally conveys the wrong meaning.</p>

    <h2>Types of Pragmatic Mismatch</h2>

    <h3>Type 1: Misinterpreting the Speech Act</h3>
    <p>The listener understands the words but misses the intended action.</p>
    <p class="bg-blue-50 p-3 rounded-md border-l-4 border-blue-300 text-sm">
      I once said, “It’s cold here with the door open,” hoping someone would close it (a request). The response was only a polite nod—no one moved.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-brand-700">Pop culture illustration: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xbYD79_g98" class="underline hover:text-brand-600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory</a> often fails to pick up implied requests or indirect hints.</p>

    <h3>Type 2: Inappropriate Transfer by Second-Language Speakers</h3>
    <p>Second-language (L2) speakers might fail to convey what they intend, transferring expressions directly from their first language.</p>
    <p class="bg-blue-50 p-3 rounded-md border-l-4 border-blue-300 text-sm">
      While talking to my landlord, I said “either way” intending “es lo mismo” in Spanish (“it’s the same”), but the phrase confused them.
    </p>

    <h3>Type 3: Misjudging Social Norms and Politeness</h3>
    <p>Misunderstandings can stem from hidden rules about politeness, directness, or social distance.</p>
    <p class="bg-blue-50 p-3 rounded-md border-l-4 border-blue-300 text-sm">
      In Spanish, using a formal second-person imperative like “Cierre la puerta” (“Close the door”) is polite. In English, the same phrasing can sound abrupt or even rude.
    </p>

    <h3>Type 4: Emotional Force in Multilingualism</h3>
    <p>Research by Pavlenko (2005) and Dewaele (2010) shows that multilingual speakers perceive the emotional force of words differently across their languages. Many multilinguals also switch languages to express strong emotions. This can create misunderstandings if emotional intensity is misjudged by others.</p>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Misunderstandings are part of everyday life—but in intercultural communication they carry higher stakes. Understanding the <em>how</em>, <em>why</em>, and <em>who</em> of misunderstanding helps us reflect on our intentions, our listeners, and the context of interaction. This awareness can reduce miscommunication and build better relationships across cultures.</p>

    <h2>The Linguistic Field Behind It: Pragmatics</h2>
    <p>These observations belong to the field of <strong>Pragmatics</strong>, which studies meaning in interaction. Pragmatics underpins much of <strong>Intercultural Communication Studies</strong>, which is a core part of Years 1 and 2 in the BA Linguistics programme at Manchester Metropolitan University.</p>

    <h2>Try It Yourself</h2>
    <p>Think of a misunderstanding you’ve experienced in a cross-cultural setting. What type might it be? Was it caused by language, culture, or both? Could greater awareness have prevented it?</p>
