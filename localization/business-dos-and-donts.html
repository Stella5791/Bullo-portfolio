      <p>This guide emerged from recognising how often pragmatic strategies collapse when content is localised word-for-word.</p>
      <p>In my academic work on intercultural pragmatics, I studied how cultures differ in managing face, politeness and directness. When I began reviewing business copy for localisation, I recognised the same patterns of pragmatic failure that I had once seen in multilingual conversations.</p>
      <p>A message crafted to sound playful and engaging in English could sound careless or disrespectful to Spanish readers. These were not vocabulary errors but misalignments in tone logic.</p>
      <p>This guide captures the principles I use to help businesses carry their cultural intent intact, not just their words, when they go global.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-medium mb-4">Closing reflection</h2>
      <p>Successful localisation is not just saying the same thing in another language. It is recreating the intended effect, so the message lands with the same clarity, warmth, and respect in every culture.</p>
