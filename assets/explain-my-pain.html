    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Pain brings people to the clinic, yet it resists description. Words hesitate when sensation steals language. Although numbers on a scale possess a reassuring neatness, they cannot hold what it feels like to live with endometriosis. In that space where language thins, patients reach for images. They speak of fire, knives, stones, monsters, and electricity. These metaphors are not embellishment. They are attempts to share what cannot otherwise be seen.</p>
    <p>When such language reaches a consultation it often remains untranscribed. It sits in the air rather than in the record. <em>Explain My Pain</em> was designed so that those images can travel intact. It listens to free text, recognises patterns that recur in research, and returns two forms of writing. One is for the patient, who needs reassurance and clarity. The other is for the clinician, who needs structure and signals.</p>

    <h2>Background: pain and the difficulty of expression</h2>
    <p>Scholars have long noted that pain pushes against language, breaking it into fragments even as it demands attention. In endometriosis, where pain is cyclical, intrusive, and often invisible, women craft metaphors that pull their experience into view. Heat and cutting speak to sensation, while predators and traps speak to emotion. My analysis of endometriosis narratives showed how these images echo wider cultural stories of violence, invasion, and contamination, which patients repurpose to make sense of their own bodies <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354450348_The_bloodiness_and_horror_of_it_Intertextuality_in_metaphorical_accounts_of_endometriosis_pain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bullo 2021</a>. A later study explored how visuals carry what words leave unsaid, using texture and colour to materialise pain in ways that conversation rarely permits <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378868124_Visual_reconstructions_of_endometriosis_pain_An_interdisciplinary_visual_methodology_for_illness_representation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bullo et&nbsp;al. 2024</a>.</p>

    <h2>Conceptual metaphor and the classification of pain</h2>
    <p>Conceptual metaphor theory offers a way to see pattern where language seems chaotic. Work by Elena Semino and colleagues describes how pain is repeatedly framed as a force, an opponent, an object, or a container, among other domains. Their analyses, grounded in patient discourse and corpus methods, show that metaphor is systematic rather than random, and that it can be studied with care <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254306724_Descriptions_of_Pain_Metaphor_and_Embodied_Simulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semino 2010</a>; see also the broader programme on illness metaphors <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346953532_Semino_E_Demjen_Z_Hardie_A_Payne_S_Rayson_P_2018_Metaphor_Cancer_and_the_End_of_Life_A_Corpus-based_Study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semino et&nbsp;al. 2018</a>. Building on that foundation, endometriosis‑specific studies have mapped recurring images in women’s accounts, including personified pain and parallel worlds, which confirm both the regularity and the condition‑specific texture of metaphor use <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344245694_Parallel_worlds_and_personified_pain_A_mixed-methods_analysis_of_pain_metaphor_use_by_women_with_endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hearn et&nbsp;al. 2020</a>.</p>

    <h2>What clinicians say</h2>
    <p>In our study with practitioners, published in <em>Frontiers</em>, doctors described the strain of interpreting pain when evidence is scant and time is short. They noted that metaphor can feel subjective, yet they also recognised its value when interpreted cautiously. Burning may hint at inflammation. Cutting may indicate sharp and acute tissue irritation. Weight may suggest pressure or adhesion. The challenge, they told us, lies in translating metaphor into notes that guide decisions without silencing the person who spoke them <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356210077_Addressing_Challenges_in_Endometriosis_Pain_Communication_Between_Patients_and_Doctors_The_Role_of_Language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bullo et&nbsp;al. 2021</a>.</p>

    <h2>The turn to technology</h2>
    <p>A taxonomy is useful on paper, but it becomes practical when it is implemented. With Python we assembled a small system that listens for metaphor types, matches them to research‑derived categories, and writes two summaries. We kept the logic deterministic so that behaviour remains transparent and testable. Regular expressions compile the expressions that patients actually use. Entailments align with interpretations in the literature and with the best practice guidance on endometriosis care <a href="https://www.eshre.eu/guideline/endometriosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESHRE 2022</a>, which organises knowledge on diagnosis, pain management, and clinical decision making.</p>

    <div class="hr"></div>

    <h2>The taxonomy</h2>
    <p>The table anchors the article. The first column names the target domain. The second records a typical patient metaphor, close to the wording one might hear in clinic or read in a diary. The third is the patient‑friendly line that <em>Explain My Pain</em> produces. The fourth is the clinician note, which separates sensory from emotional signals and marks likely contexts or impacts.</p>

      <figcaption>The taxonomy connects the patient’s wording to two audiences. The explanation stays close to the original voice. The note reframes the same material as clinical signals.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2>Why this is groundbreaking</h2>
    <p>This is the first taxonomy of endometriosis pain metaphors that is both derived from patient narratives and implemented as a working tool. For years, studies captured the richness of metaphor in papers, interviews, and images. Here, that knowledge becomes operational. It enters an interface that listens, re‑voices, and structures pain in real time. In doing so, metaphor moves from anecdote to evidence.</p>
    <p>Because the logic is transparent, behaviour can be audited and tested. Because categories are grounded in research, outputs align with published interpretations and with clinical guidance for endometriosis care <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35350465/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Becker et&nbsp;al. 2022</a>. Most importantly, because the system writes two narratives from the same text, the patient keeps her voice while the clinician gains a clear set of cues.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Pain may damage language, yet it also invents it. When a person says it feels like fire, those words should not vanish. They should be heard, carried, and translated with care. <em>Explain My Pain</em> takes metaphors seriously precisely because they are how people make sense of their bodies. By placing them in a taxonomy and turning them into gentle explanations and clinician notes, the app offers a meeting point where lived language and clinical practice can work together.</p>
    <p>The future lies in listening with greater attention. The taxonomy can expand across languages and cultures. The interface can include images as well as text. And because the code remains open to testing, each addition can be made without losing sight of the person who spoke first.</p>
